# Intel Website Localization üåç

[üëâ **View the Live Project Here**](https://cashmerecode.github.io/intel-sustainability-localization/)

This project builds on my previous **Intel Sustainability Timeline** by adding **localization, accessibility, and Bootstrap enhancements**.  
The timeline remains intact, but I extended the site to work for a **global audience**.

---

## What‚Äôs New in This Project
- **Right-to-Left (RTL) support** for languages like Arabic and Hebrew  
- **Bootstrap three-column section** with icons and styled ‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù buttons  
- **Newsletter subscription form** with labels, validation, and accessible error messages  
- **Footer** with placeholder links and dynamic copyright year  
- **Accessibility improvements** (Lighthouse ‚â•90) including color contrast, alt attributes, and semantic structure  
- **LevelUp (extra credit):** Auto-detect language script that flips layout dynamically between LTR/RTL  

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, media queries, transitions, Bootstrap 5)  
- JavaScript (timeline interactivity + RTL detection script)  

---

## Connection to Previous Project
- **Project 2 (Timeline):** Focused on Intel‚Äôs milestones with a responsive, interactive timeline.  
- **Project 3 (Localization):** Keeps the timeline intact, but adds **global-ready features** like RTL, Bootstrap sections, subscription form, and accessibility upgrades.  

This repo shows how a project can evolve from a simple timeline into a **localized, accessible, production-style site**.
