## Reflections
### Creating a Webpage  
Making this webpage showed me that design and function have to work together. I had to think about how it looks on different screens and how easy it is for someone to navigate. I realized building a site isn‚Äôt just coding, it‚Äôs about making something people actually enjoy using. That‚Äôs why I added some JavaScript on top of the rubric requirements, just to give it a little extra flare.

### Networking  
This project reminded me that networking is important, not just in tech but anywhere. Intel‚Äôs progress comes from teaming up with others, and I can do the same by building connections for new ideas and opportunities. It showed me how important it is to not just work alone but grow through people around me.

### Company Culture  
Intel‚Äôs story showed me how much culture shapes a company‚Äôs direction. When sustainability is part of the culture, it pushes people to think big and act responsibly. It made me see that culture isn‚Äôt just what happens inside a company it also shapes how the world sees it.
